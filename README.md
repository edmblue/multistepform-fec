### ðŸ“‘ End note 

Oh dude, this project gave me a lot of headaches rendering dynamic components but I feel SO GOOD after I finished it, I really enjoy doing this and I will keep moving forward. Also learning little by little on how to use TypeScript, I'm loving it, it's really helping me to debug my code as I go and I appreciate that

<sub>**Additional**: I will start using more git and not only deploying when the project is ready</sub>
